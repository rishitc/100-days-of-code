# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 9, 2020 (Data Science & Competitive Programming)
##### Visualising data using Matplotlib and competitive programming on LeetCode, HackerEarth & HackerRank

**Today's Progress**: 

- Worked on learning and getting comfortable with the syntax of Matplotlib
  - Started the freeCodeCamp video on [Matplotlib Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xc3CA655Y4)
  - Began working on visualising the [Daily Power Generation in India (2017-2020) Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/navinmundhra/daily-power-generation-in-india-20172020?select=file.csv)
- Finished LeetCode July Daily Challenge Questions [3Sum](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/545/week-2-july-8th-july-14th/3384/) and [Maximum Width of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/545/week-2-july-8th-july-14th/3385/)
- Finished HackerRank question on [CamelCase](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/camelcase/problem?utm_campaign=challenge-recommendation&utm_medium=email&utm_source=24-hour-campaign) and [Birthday Chocolate](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-birthday-bar/problem?utm_campaign=challenge-recommendation&utm_medium=email&utm_source=24-hour-campaign)
- Finished HackerEarth question on [Hexadecimal numbers](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/searching/linear-search/practice-problems/algorithm/yet-another-easy-problem-1f3273a0/description/)
- Submitted an [issue and assign request on GitHub](https://github.com/ronreiter/interactive-tutorials/issues/499), to the [learnpython.org](https://github.com/ronreiter/interactive-tutorials) repository to work on a mistake in the python exercise.
  - Will keep a track of this to see if there are any updates from the repository's maintainers

**Thoughts:** 

The HackerRank and HackerEarth questions were quite interesting an I was able to solve then efficiently. The LeetCode question were a bit more challenging but I was able to figure them out

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
