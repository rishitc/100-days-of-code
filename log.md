# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 9, 2020 (Data Science & Competitive Programming)
##### Visualising data using Matplotlib and competitive programming on LeetCode, HackerEarth & HackerRank

**Today's Progress**: 

- Worked on learning and getting comfortable with the syntax of Matplotlib
  - Started the freeCodeCamp video on [Matplotlib Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xc3CA655Y4)
  - Began working on visualising the [Daily Power Generation in India (2017-2020) Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/navinmundhra/daily-power-generation-in-india-20172020?select=file.csv)
- Finished LeetCode July Daily Challenge Questions [3Sum](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/545/week-2-july-8th-july-14th/3384/) and [Maximum Width of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/545/week-2-july-8th-july-14th/3385/)
- Finished HackerRank question on [CamelCase](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/camelcase/problem?utm_campaign=challenge-recommendation&utm_medium=email&utm_source=24-hour-campaign) and [Birthday Chocolate](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-birthday-bar/problem?utm_campaign=challenge-recommendation&utm_medium=email&utm_source=24-hour-campaign)
- Finished HackerEarth question on [Hexadecimal numbers](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/searching/linear-search/practice-problems/algorithm/yet-another-easy-problem-1f3273a0/description/)
- Submitted an [issue and assign request on GitHub](https://github.com/ronreiter/interactive-tutorials/issues/499), to the [learnpython.org](https://github.com/ronreiter/interactive-tutorials) repository to work on a mistake in the python exercise.
  - Will keep a track of this to see if there are any updates from the repository's maintainers

**Thoughts:** 

The HackerRank and HackerEarth questions were quite engaging while quite simple in approach. I was ecstatic that I was able to solve them efficiently. However, the LeetCode challenges were a bit more demanding. In the end, I was able to figure out how to solve them.

### Day 1: July 10, 2020 (Data Science & Competitive Programming)

##### Visualising data using Matplotlib and competitive programming on LeetCode & HackerRank

**Today's Progress**: 

- Worked on learning and getting comfortable with the syntax of Matplotlib
  - Finished the freeCodeCamp video on [Matplotlib Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xc3CA655Y4)
- Finished HackerRank question on [Migratory Birds](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/migratory-birds/problem?utm_campaign=challenge-recommendation&utm_medium=email&utm_source=24-hour-campaign)
- Finished LeetCode July Daily Challenge Question [Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/545/week-2-july-8th-july-14th/3386/) and [Subsets](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/545/week-2-july-8th-july-14th/3387/)

**Thoughts:** 

The LeetCode challenges were quite enjoyable. For the ["Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List"](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/545/week-2-july-8th-july-14th/3386/) question, I attempted it using a recursive and iterative solution. By doing this exercise, I learnt a lot about the flow of the program using both techniques.

Also, I'm quite ecstatic that I was able to finish the **"Matplotlib Crash Course"** *YouTube video*. It was quite engaging and following along with the instructor while trying out my variations during the process made the learning process engaging and fun. 
I am eager to try out my new skills on some dataset from *Kaggle*. I have narrowed down on a dataset which I want to try my hands on, but before I can jump into working on that plan, I feel I need to learn about **Pandas** which is another powerful Python library for *Data Science*. Hopefully, I can begin work on that from tomorrow.

### Day 2: July 11, 2020 (Java Programming)

##### Worked on learning Java programming on JetBrains Academy

**Today's Progress**: 

- Worked on learning and getting comfortable with Java programming on JetBrains Academy
- Finished LeetCode July Daily Challenge Question [Reverse Bits](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/545/week-2-july-8th-july-14th/3388/)

**Thoughts:** 

I am still learning the ***basics of Java***, but the exercise questions, primarily the **medium** and **hard ones**, are very engaging and take the boredom out of learning the basics. It makes you think more algorithmically in terms of the abstraction of the steps to follow and finally how to put those steps into code. The **code quality checks** are another feature I found very helpful. Writing code that follows important style rules to make the program more readable and visually appealing was very encouraging and satisfying.

Finally, I worked on the LeetCode July Daily Challenge question on ["Reverse Bits"](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/545/week-2-july-8th-july-14th/3388/), wherein you take in a number, and reverse its bits and return the result. Tackling the challenge in Python was tricky as I wanted to get the *Most Significant Bit* first from the number's binary representation in memory, for example, the 31st bit of a 32-bit number (if you start your counting from 0), and then **"bitwise or"** it to the answer variable. In Python, however, the size of an integer is *variable* so figuring out the *Most Significant Bit* of the number is confusing. Thankfully the question mentioned that the number is a **32-bit unsigned integer**. So I needed to work with only the first 32-bits of the unsigned integer and ignore the remaining bits (if any). I, however, attempted the question in **C** as I found bit-manipulations easier in **C**, nevertheless I will work on *learning bit manipulations* in Python as well.

### Day 3: July 12, 2020 (Data Science & Competitive Programming)

##### Starting learning the Pandas library and competitive programming on LeetCode

**Today's Progress**: 

- Worked on learning and getting comfortable with using the Pandas library
- Finished LeetCode July Daily Challenge Question [Same Tree](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/545/week-2-july-8th-july-14th/3389/)

**Thoughts:** 

Today I started learning the ***Pandas*** *library*, which is very useful for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time-series data. I have only scratched the surface of the features and functions of the library, but I am amazed by the level of *fine-grained control* one can achieve while using **Pandas**. Hopefully, I can complete learning the rest of the basics before moving on to my *Kaggle* data visualisation project. I have been playing around with this idea in my mind for a while now. Hopefully, I get the chance to execute it soon.

Finally, I worked on the LeetCode July Daily Challenge question on ["Same Tree"](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/545/week-2-july-8th-july-14th/3389/). The challenge was quite easy as I was able to complete it quite quickly. I used **Java** to code the solution, I am quite happy that I have reached a level that I can start *programming comfortably* in **Java** now. The time spent on **JetBrains academy** seems to be well spent. I still have a lot to learn but I feel I have got a good start.

### Day 4: July 13, 2020 (Data Science & Competitive Programming)

##### Finished learning the Pandas library and competitive programming on LeetCode

**Today's Progress**: 

- Finished learning and getting comfortable with using the Pandas library
- Finished LeetCode July Daily Challenge Question [Merge Two Binary Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-binary-trees/submissions/)

**Thoughts:** 

I finally finished learning the basics of the Pandas library. I still need to learn more about advanced use cases as well as how to apply what I have learned on a real-world dataset. I feel I should be able to finish figuring out these last two hurdles by tomorrow. I have set a deadline to when I should complete working on my project. Hopefully, I can start working on that by Wednesday, so that I can finish it by Friday.

Finally, I worked on the LeetCode question on ["Merge Two Binary Trees"](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-binary-trees/submissions/). I had to spend some time thinking as to how to solve the challenge. I spent some time on pen and paper scribbling my ideas and approaches to figure out the steps to answer the challenge. I also visited a few websites to get some ideas for a possible solution. All this effort helped me solve the problem successfully. I again used **Java** to code the solution. I feel like my comfort level is increasing day by day with **Java**, and that's very encouraging.

### Day 5: July 14, 2020 (Data Science & Competitive Programming)

##### Reviewing what I have learnt and competitive programming on LeetCode

**Today's Progress**: 

- Spent time reviewing what I have learned about the Pandas library
- Finished LeetCode July Daily Challenge Question [Angle Between Hands of a Clock](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/545/week-2-july-8th-july-14th/3390/)

**Thoughts:** 

I spent some time reviewing what I have learned about the Pandas library till now. I feel it's a good idea to take a day and review what I have learnt, before moving to the advanced concepts tomorrow.

Finally, I worked on the LeetCode July Daily Challenge question on ["Angle Between Hands of a Clock"](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/545/week-2-july-8th-july-14th/3390/). I initially used **Java** to code the solution. After completing that, I reprogrammed my solution in **C**, **C++**, **Python** and **C#**, while also using the features of each language to make my task of typing the program simpler. The programs I coded in each of the programming languages were quite efficient, which was a great outcome of the exercise.

### Day 6: July 15, 2020 (Data Science & Competitive Programming)

##### Applying what I learnt in Pandas on a real Dataset and competitive programming on LeetCode

**Today's Progress**: 

- Started looking up how to solve real world data science problems with Pandas

- Solved the HackerRank Question [Day of the Programmer](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/day-of-the-programmer/problem?h_r=profile)
- Finished LeetCode July Daily Challenge Question [Reverse Words in a String](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/546/week-3-july-15th-july-21st/3391/)

**Thoughts:** 

I spent some time looking up how to solve real world data science problems with Pandas. This is the last tutorial I look at before I start work on my project.

I solved the HackerRank question ["Day of the Programmer"](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/day-of-the-programmer/problem?h_r=profile) using Python. It took only a few lines to solve but it was worth the experience. The question had a good description of how the transition from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar took place in Russia and how they compensated for the time shift from this transition, and how that effects the problem your trying to solve.

Finally, I worked on the LeetCode July Daily Challenge question on ["Reverse Words in a String"](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/546/week-3-july-15th-july-21st/3391/). I initially used **Python** to code the solution. After completing that, I reprogrammed my solution in **Java**, while also using the features of each language to make my task of typing the program simpler. The programs I coded in each of the programming languages were quite efficient, which was a great outcome of the exercise.

### Day 7: July 16, 2020 (Competitive Programming & Mini Project)

##### Competitive programming on LeetCode and Worked on making a Toy Virtual Machine

**Today's Progress**: 

- Finished LeetCode July Daily Challenge Question [Pow\(x, n\) Solution](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/546/week-3-july-15th-july-21st/3392/)
- Worked on making a simple Virtual Machine

**Thoughts:** 

I followed a blog by Felix Angell on how to make a simple Virtual Machine in **C**. It was really fun and I will try to continue this project further. I feel that going forward I should write this project in **C++** rather than **C** as I can then take advantage of C++'s Object Oriented Paradigm features to make the code easier to write, maintain and most importantly understand.

Finally, I worked on the LeetCode July Daily Challenge Question on ["Pow\(x, n\) Solution"](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/546/week-3-july-15th-july-21st/3392/).

##### Competitive programming on LeetCode and continued working on my Personal Project, also started reading a blog on personal organisation

**Today's Progress**: 

- Finished LeetCode July Daily Challenge Question [Word Search](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/july-leetcoding-challenge/546/week-3-july-15th-july-21st/3397/)
- Spent time investigating the reason for missing values in the dataset
- Started reading a blog on "*Personal Organisation*"

**Thoughts:**

It's been 12 days since I started and I am ecstatic that I have been able to continue solving 1 question on LeetCode every day. Hopefully, I can convert this into a habit as I feel I am learning quite a lot and can apply it in the problems I come across.

I have read that it takes at least 21 days to form a new habit and I know that I'll be able to do it, as it is something I enjoy doing. Who knew problem-solving would be so fun!

Also, I spent some time investigating the cause for the missing data as I felt that there might be a good reason for its absence. The reason for the missing data will surely help me in understanding the best way to fill the cells of missing data (or delete those rows if it makes sense).

I also started reading a blog on "*Personal Organisation*" which I found on freeCodeCamp. It is quite lengthy, I have finished reading about a quarter of it, and I'm gripped by the author Lucas Santos' insights, advice and techniques. I'll try to finish reading the blog in the next few days.
